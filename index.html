  <p>Traditional First Nations clothing is an identification of your band and/or family (name); representing generations of your family’s history, transmitting stories,wisdom and property for generations to come. The creation of beautiful and practical objects (for all tribal communities) served as a means of art provided by Indigenous people from your village, with a tie to the land by depicting their family crest; usually animals and colors. Due to the abundance of natural resources and the affluence of most tribes, there was plenty of leisure time to create art. Many works of art served practical purposes, such as clothing, tools, weapons of war and hunting, transportation, cooking, and shelter; but others were purely aesthetic.</p>

  <p>Before Europeans arrived and introduced cloth, most coastal people wore minimal clothing. Men went naked when weather permitted and women would wear a simple skirt made of shredded and woven cedar strips. The First Nations people of the Northwest Coast have a very rich tradition of hats, cloaks, body armor, and masks. All made of cedar or animal hides. Clothing and regalia are a traditional symbol of status among First Nations people. Cedar bark was woven into water-repellent capes, which were sometimes trimmed with sea-otter pelts. Cedar-bark skirts and hats were also made. First Nations people in B.C. wore hide moccasins, but often went barefoot on the West Coast. High status women of northern coastal British Columbia wore labrets. In some First Nations traditions, both men and women were tattooed. On the central coast, a high-ranking baby’s head would be strapped to a board during infancy to shape it; the flattened forehead signified nobility.</p>

  <p>Nuu-chah-nulth hats were and still made of cedar bark in a wrap and twine weave and designs were woven into them. The Nuu-chah-nulth whaler’s hat, also known as the Maquinna hat, have a kind of dome at the top.</p>
<p>Clothing, a basic requirement of man, is found in one form or another in every society. Today with the legacies of folk memory, historic accounts and early we have a rather detailed picture of the traditional clothing worn by the Nuu-chah-nulth people at the time of contact and earlier. As with most aspects of their existence, the Nuu-chah-nulth people were strongly influenced by the coastal climate and the natural resources in developing their distinctive cedar-bark clothing. It was only during the last couple of decades of the nineteenth century that the practical hand-woven garments were gradually replaced with the mass manufactured apparel of the day. While clothing is worn for modesty, to enhance the wearer's appearance and to serve as an indicator of the individual's wealth, rank and role or function within the group, its main purpose is to provide protection against the elements. The fine West Coast summers permitted traditional garb to be kept to a minimal for the most part. Children under the age of twelve* went about their daily activities with no clothing.</p>
<p>*infants even fashioned an absorbent diaper made from the finest shredded yellow cedar bark imaginable.</p>
