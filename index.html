  <p>Traditional First Nations clothing is an identification of your band and/or family (name); representing generations of your family’s history, transmitting stories,wisdom and property for generations to come. The creation of beautiful and practical objects (for all tribal communities) served as a means of art provided by Indigenous people from your village, with a tie to the land by depicting their family crest; usually animals and colors. Due to the abundance of natural resources and the affluence of most tribes, there was plenty of leisure time to create art. Many works of art served practical purposes, such as clothing, tools, weapons of war and hunting, transportation, cooking, and shelter; but others were purely aesthetic.</p>

  <p>Before Europeans arrived and introduced cloth, most coastal people wore minimal clothing. Men went naked when weather permitted and women would wear a simple skirt made of shredded and woven cedar strips. The First Nations people of the Northwest Coast have a very rich tradition of hats, cloaks, body armor, and masks. All made of cedar or animal hides. Clothing and regalia are a traditional symbol of status among First Nations people. Cedar bark was woven into water-repellent capes, which were sometimes trimmed with sea-otter pelts. Cedar-bark skirts and hats were also made. First Nations people in B.C. wore hide moccasins, but often went barefoot on the West Coast. High status women of northern coastal British Columbia wore labrets. In some First Nations traditions, both men and women were tattooed. On the central coast, a high-ranking baby’s head would be strapped to a board during infancy to shape it; the flattened forehead signified nobility.</p>
