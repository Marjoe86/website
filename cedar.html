       <p>Nuu-chah-nulth hats were and still made of cedar bark in a wrap and twine weave and designs were woven into them. The Nuu-chah-nulth whaler’s hat, also known as the Maquinna hat, have a kind of dome at the top.</p>
     <p>Clothing, a basic requirement of man, is found in one form or another in every society. Today with the legacies of folk memory, historic accounts and early we have a rather detailed picture of the traditional clothing worn by the Nuu-chah-nulth people at the time of contact and earlier. As with most aspects of their existence, the Nuu-chah-nulth people were strongly influenced by the coastal climate and the natural resources in developing their distinctive cedar-bark clothing. It was only during the last couple of decades of the nineteenth century that the practical hand-woven garments were gradually replaced with the mass manufactured apparel of the day. While clothing is worn for modesty, to enhance the wearer's appearance and to serve as an indicator of the individual's wealth, rank and role or function within the group, its main purpose is to provide protection against the elements. The fine West Coast summers permitted traditional garb to be kept to a minimal for the most part. Children under the age of twelve* went about their daily activities with no clothing.</p>
     <p>*infants even fashioned an absorbent diaper made from the finest shredded yellow cedar bark imaginable.</p>
