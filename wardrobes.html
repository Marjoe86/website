<p>During the cold rainy season protective clothing was essential. From this need evolved variety of rainwear that was water repellent, warm yet still offered freedom of movement. The special skills required to gather the bark and treat it and the techniques involved in fashioning the impressive cedar-bark garments all reflected the unique Nuu-chah-nulth culture. Unlike some of our neighbors who dressed almost exclusively in animal skins, the Nuu-chah-nulth people predominately wore garments cleverly fashioned from woven shredded cedar bark. Each garment was light-weight,
pliable and when probably prepared pleasantly soft.
The cedar bark robe, wore by both males and females was primarily for warmth.</p>
<p>A robe worn by a chief or nobility was made from the rarer yellow cedar rather than red cedar and often had a border of sea otter or mink added for luxury.</P>
<p>A cedar bark poncho was similar to a long mat but with a hole left for the persons head.</p>
<p>These outfits were often supplemented with a conical hat. Woven tightly from finely split cedar bark or spruce roots (often of a double thickness) it made an excellent waterproof article that also served as a sun visor when out on the water. A woven cedar bark headband inside kept the hat just above eye level.</p>
<p>Very little occurred in the life of the Nuu-chah-nulth people that did not include cedar. It provided, the cradles children were placed in at birth and the mats, which covered the deceased. It provided the bowls for the humblest of meals and the masks for the greatest of potlatches.</p>
<p>Nuu-chah-nulth vocabulary included a different word to name each size of cedar tree indicating its specific use. Indeed, the Nuu-chah-nulth people could be called, as one elder put it, the Cedar People.
