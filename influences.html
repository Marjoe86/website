<p>European influences had an impact on traditional wear and were introduced into new creations that still served to signify the identity of the wearer. Representations of family history were retold in button blankets, aprons, and dance shirts in the 19th century and have continued to be represented in the 21st century on button blankets, dresses, coats, vests, hats, and scarves. blankets, aprons, and dance shirts in the 19th century and have continued to be represented in the 21st century on button blankets, dresses, coats, vests, hats, and scarves.</p>
<p>Initially women would wear dresses only under their trade blankets. By the late 1800's, early 1900's most Native people were wearing tailored clothing, thus putting a virtual end to the ancient techniques used in the construction of cedar bark clothing.</p> </div></section><center>

<section><h2>Today</h2><p>Our modern day clothing consists of all different native art. From basic everday wear like; t-shirts, sweats, leggings, hoodies and baseball caps to Formal wear such as; dresses, suits, coats, and ties. You don't see many people wearing cedar woven clothes on a daily basis unless it is for a special event (potlaches, wedding, welcoming, coming of age, chiefs, naming ceremony, song and dance). There are many different world famous first nations artists, not just for clothing but as we all know about carvings, paintings and jewellary. Native art has become a big hit in not only our generation but since we were using nature to clothe us and keep us warm, make bowls, bent boxes, canoes and long houses etc.</p> </section></div>
  <p>My goal is to start my own clothing line with my native art, as I have been drawing since I was 15; when I learned to start carving. I plan on making reasonably priced clothing so that everyone can afford it.</p>
